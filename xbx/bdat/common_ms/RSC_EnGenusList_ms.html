        <td class="side">Though flightless, these avians make their[ST:n ]homes at high elevations, preying on fish and[ST:n ]crustaceans that they suck into their trumpet-[ST:n ]like mouths. Relatively intelligent creatures,[ST:n ]some saltats are known to also display a[ST:n ]penchant for combat.[ST:n ][ST:n ]During mating season, males blow rainbow[ST:n ]bubbles as a way to attract a mate. They then[ST:n ]perform a frenzied dance of courtship as the[ST:n ]bubbles drift. Failure to impress will dash all[ST:n ]prospects of mating, spurring young males to[ST:n ]improve themselves by learning at the feet of[ST:n ]senior saltats. The relationship is mutually[ST:n ]beneficial, with disciples blowing bubbles to[ST:n ]help their tutors' own romantic endeavors.[ST:n ]Even after gaining nests of their own, they[ST:n ]continue to look after their aging masters.</td>

        <td class="side">Liceors share a common ancestor with saltats,[ST:n ]and in similar fashion, the males woo[ST:n ]potential mates by dancing. However, females[ST:n ]also take a mate's \"fortune\" into account,[ST:n ]requiring them to amass a collection of[ST:n ]jewels, minerals, and curiously shaped stones[ST:n ]that are stored in a spherical thoracic pouch.[ST:n ]During the dance, the male will fling treasures[ST:n ]to divert the female's attention, affording a[ST:n ]brief chance to inch closer. Should the male[ST:n ]succeed in closing the gap completely, he will[ST:n ]have won a mate. If the female does not take[ST:n ]to her presents, however, she will dart off.[ST:n ][ST:n ]Aside from the unique mating ritual, the[ST:n ]liceor's main feature is a wildly inconsistent[ST:n ]temperament, which can switch from joy to[ST:n ]rage depending on the weather.</td>

Males are known for their territorial[ST:n ]tendencies, driving off invaders with great[ST:n ]animosity, though females may also display[ST:n ]similar traits when other creatures approach[ST:n ]their young.[ST:n ][ST:n ]Equipped with mighty fangs and horns to[ST:n ]match their temperaments, potamuses are[ST:n ]actually more dangerous than many fiercer-[ST:n ]looking carnivores. The Nopon, however,[ST:n ]have succeeded in domesticating them to[ST:n ]haul freight.</td>

The female's temperament then[ST:n ]becomes more volatile than usual, motivating[ST:n ]it to attack all it sees in order to keep her[ST:n ]child and mate fed.[ST:n ][ST:n ]Once mature, the offspring leaves its parents[ST:n ]in search of other colonies.</td>

        <td class="side">These reptiles never stop growing—their final[ST:n ]body length can easily reach over a hundred[ST:n ]meters, and their lifespan is measured in[ST:n ]centuries.

Nutrients are mostly derived[ST:n ]from mineral sources, though they may prey[ST:n ]on other creatures to aid in growth.[ST:n ]Once they have gained sufficient nutrition,[ST:n ]tersquals will shed their skin to facilitate even[ST:n ]larger sizes. After then eating said shed skin,[ST:n ]sometimes they will immediately begin to[ST:n ]shed again.[ST:n ][ST:n ]Superiority is determined by size, which keeps[ST:n ]intraspecies conflicts to a minimum.
